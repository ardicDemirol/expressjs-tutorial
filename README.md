## Tutorials and Examples

This repository includes various examples to demonstrate core concepts of Express.js:

1. **Basic Server Setup**:
   - Learn how to create your first Express.js server and respond to HTTP requests.

2. **Routing**:
   - Static routes: `/about`, `/contact`
   - Dynamic routes: `/user/:id`
   - Nested routes: `/api/v1/products`

3. **Middleware**:
   - Built-in middleware like `express.json()` and `express.static()`.
   - Third-party middleware like `body-parser`, `morgan`, and `cors`.
   - Custom middleware for logging, authentication, and more.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement centralized error-handling middleware.

5. **Templating Engines**:
   - Set up EJS or Pug for rendering dynamic views.

6. **RESTful APIs**:
   - Build a full CRUD API for a sample resource (e.g., "Products" or "Users").

7. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `dotenv` to manage environment-specific configuration.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Steps to deploy the application to a cloud platform.

## Best Practices

- **Folder Structure**: Organize your project into `routes`, `middleware`, `controllers`, and `models`.
- **Use Middleware Wisely**: Apply middleware only where needed to avoid performance issues.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Capture and handle all errors in one place.
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files to manage secrets and configuration.
- **Security**:
  - Use libraries like `helmet` for securing HTTP headers.
  - Validate input using libraries like `joi` or `express-validator`.
- **Logging**:
  - Use `morgan` for HTTP request logging.
  - Implement a robust logging system for error tracking.
